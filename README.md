# Q Server

__Q__ is a system that lets journalists create visual elements for stories. It is developed by [NZZ Storytelling](https://www.nzz.ch/storytelling) and used in the [NZZ](https://www.nzz.ch) newsroom.

This is the server for the Q Toolbox. To make use of Q server you will also need a [Q editor](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-editor/).
