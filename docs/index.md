title: Q server
---
__Q__ is a system that lets journalists create visual elements for stories. It is developed by [NZZ Storytelling](https://www.nzz.ch/storytelling) and used in the [NZZ](https://www.nzz.ch) newsroom.

_This is the documentation for Q server. You will need to setup [Q editor](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-editor) and at least one tool to get a working environment._

Demo: [https://editor.q.tools](https://editor.q.tools)

# Terminology
- __Q__ is used as the name for a complete system containing a [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), a Q server, a [Q editor](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-editor) and some _tools_.
- __Q server__ is a HTTP service providing an API as a proxy to several tool services
- __Q server implementation__ implements a [hapi](https://hapijs.com/) server using the plugins provided by [@nzz/q-server](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-server) and providing configuration for your very specific environment including _tool_, _target_ and _editor_ configuration. We've setup a [demo implementation](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-server-demo), please see also [installation instructions](install.html)
- __Q editor__ is a Web application used to create new _items_ and preview the rendering. Head over to [Q editor](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-editor) to learn more.
- __Tool__ is a HTTP service providing an API to get rendering information for a given dataset (there is some more in a tool, see the page about [developing tools](developing-tools.html)).
- __Item__ is a document in the CouchDB. It contains information about the tool and the data to be used to create something useful for a given _target_.
- __Target__ is a named configuration defining stylesheets and tool endpoints to use. Q server can use different tool endpoints to get a _rendering info_ for a different target (e.g. Website, native mobile App, Infoscreens). Read more [about targets](about-targets.html).

# Architecture
This should give you an overview of Q's architecture. The Q editor is not part of this diagram, it only shows the delivery part of Q.
